# property: glass transition temperature
# destination unit: °C
# 'calculation':: multiplication: 0, additon: 1.
# 'power of 10' recognized in other than physical values:: use as the reciprocal in some cases: 0, always positive power: 1, always negative power: 2.
# 'start':: If the 2nd part is unnecessary, start=None in the 2nd part, otherwise, start=(number).
# 'order_non_fix':: describing order of component units is fixed: 0, not fixed: 1.
# '999' is used as a dummy for empty character and white space. It is deleted in the unit conversion program.
